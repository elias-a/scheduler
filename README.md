# Scheduler

The scheduler program was designed to create a schedule of matchups over a number of weeks. The inputs are: 
* Number of weeks
* The entities (teams, people, etc.)
* Limits on the number of matchups between two entities
* The minimum number of allowed weeks between a repeated matchup

The program outputs the schedules in CSV and PDF form.
